## 1. Hero Section

**Goal**: Communicate value and capture attention in 8 seconds.

### Headline Rules
- Lead with the biggest, clearest benefit
- Use the visitor's language, not industry jargon
- Max 10 words - every word must earn its place
- Test: Can someone understand the value with ONLY the headline?

### Subheadline Rules
- Amplify urgency or add specificity the headline couldn't fit
- Answer "what's in it for me" directly
- Max 20 words
- Can include a proof point (number of users, key metric)

### CTA Rules
- Most visually prominent element on the page
- Action-oriented, first-person language: "Start my free trial" > "Sign up"
- Include risk reducer below button: "No credit card required" or "Free for 14 days"
- One primary CTA only - don't split attention

### Visual Guidance (for HTML/CSS phase)
- Include a product screenshot, dashboard mockup, or hero illustration
- Fast loading - hero image affects bounce rate directly
- Trust indicator above fold (logo bar or stat)

---

## 2. Trust Bar / Authority Section

**Goal**: Trigger authority bias - "if they trust it, so can I"

### Rules
- Place immediately after hero to reduce resistance early
- 4-6 logos maximum - more feels desperate, fewer feels unproven
- Use monochrome/greyscale logos to maintain visual hierarchy
- Add context: "Trusted by 500+ companies" or "Used by teams at"
- If no logos yet: use press mentions, certifications, or "Built by engineers from [known company]"

### Fallback (early-stage products)
- Integration partner logos ("Works with Slack, GitHub, Jira")
- Certification badges (SOC2, GDPR, ISO)
- Investor/accelerator logos
- "Featured in" press logos

---

## 3. Loss Aversion Section

**Goal**: Amplify top 3 pain points WITHOUT offering solutions yet. Create emotional tension.

### Rules
- Focus on consequences of inaction, not current state
- Use external villains (market pressure, competition, wasted time) - never blame the ICP
- Keep specific and relatable - generic pain doesn't convert
- Subtle approach - avoid fear-mongering that causes bounce
- Position before benefits to create psychological tension for resolution

### Structure
Write 3 pain points, each with:
- **Bold headline**: Name the pain concisely
- **1-2 sentences**: Describe the consequence of not solving it
- **Implied cost**: Time, money, reputation, or opportunity lost

### Tone
- Empathetic, not aggressive
- "You know the feeling when..." not "You're failing because..."
- Acknowledge the problem is hard, not that they're doing it wrong

### When to Skip
- If the ICP is highly logical/analytical (engineers, scientists) - use a lighter version
- If the product is a nice-to-have, not a must-have - skip entirely
- If the brand is premium/luxury - loss aversion feels cheap

---

## 4. Benefits Section

**Goal**: Focus on outcomes - what they gain, not how you deliver it.

### Rules
- Use the rule of 3: three benefits max for cognitive ease and recall
- Frontload the biggest win in each headline to trigger desire
- Headlines = specific gains, subtext = brief mechanism
- Add numbers/timeframes for credibility: "30% faster", "in under 5 minutes"
- Position benefits as inevitable results, not possibilities
- "You will" not "You might" or "You can"

### Structure per Benefit
- **Icon** (note for HTML phase): Simple, recognizable
- **Headline**: Specific outcome in 5-8 words
- **Supporting text**: 1-2 sentences explaining how this happens
- **Proof point** (optional): Stat, quote snippet, or comparison

### Common Mistakes
- Listing features disguised as benefits ("AI-powered" is a feature, "Save 10 hours/week" is a benefit)
- Too many benefits dilute impact - pick the top 3
- Vague outcomes ("improve productivity" - by how much? doing what?)

---

## 5. Process Section

**Goal**: Reduce perceived effort by showing how simple success is.

### Rules
- Maximum 3 steps - anything more increases perceived complexity
- Use logical sequence: Setup → Action → Reward (dopamine loop)
- Emphasize simplicity: "just", "simply", "in minutes"
- Add time estimates to each step when possible
- Each step should feel achievable and low-effort

### Structure
For each step:
- **Step number**: Visual indicator (1, 2, 3)
- **Action headline**: What the user does (imperative, 3-5 words)
- **Description**: 1 sentence on what happens and why it's easy
- **Time estimate** (optional): "Takes 2 minutes"

### Framing
- Frame as a journey: from problem → solution → outcome
- Final step should be the desired result, not an action
- Example: "1. Connect your tools → 2. Set your rules → 3. Watch it work"

---

## 6. Features Section

**Goal**: Provide technical proof for analytical decision-makers.

### Rules
- At this point in the page, users expect technical details
- Feature headlines should be simple and descriptive - clarity over cleverness
- Group related features to reduce cognitive load
- Connect each feature to a benefit (briefly)
- Highlight what competitors lack
- Use icons or visuals to break up text-heavy content

### Structure
- **6-8 features** organized in a grid (2-3 columns)
- Each feature:
  - **Icon** (note for HTML phase)
  - **Name**: 2-4 word descriptive label
  - **Description**: 1-2 sentences, feature → benefit connection
- Optional: "And more..." link to full feature page

### Depth Adjustment
- **Technical ICP** (developers, engineers): Include specs, API details, performance numbers
- **Business ICP** (managers, executives): Focus on outcomes each feature enables
- **Mixed audience**: Lead with outcome, parenthetical tech detail

---

## 7. Pricing Section

**Goal**: Make the investment decision easy and attractive.

### Rules
- Transparency reduces anxiety - show prices, don't hide them
- Use anchor pricing: show higher-priced option first or most prominently
- Highlight the "recommended" or "popular" option (goldilocks effect)
- Break down cost per use/day/month to minimize perceived cost
- Include guarantee language to reduce risk

### Structure
- **2-3 tiers** (more creates decision paralysis)
- Each tier:
  - **Name**: Descriptive (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
  - **Price**: Clear, with billing period
  - **Best for**: One-line describing ideal user
  - **Features**: Bullet list, check marks for included
  - **CTA**: Tier-specific ("Start free", "Go Pro", "Contact sales")
- **Highlight**: Visual emphasis on recommended tier

### Psychology
- Annual discount to trigger loss aversion: "Save $200/year"
- Free tier/trial removes entry barrier
- "Most popular" badge uses social proof
- Enterprise tier makes Pro feel like a deal (anchor pricing)

### When Pricing is Complex
- If pricing depends on usage: show calculator or "Starting at $X"
- If enterprise-only: "Book a demo" with value bullets instead of prices
- Always give some price signal - "Starting at" beats hidden pricing

---

## 8. Testimonials Section

**Goal**: Transfer trust through credible social proof.

### Rules
- Specific outcomes with numbers: "Increased revenue by 40%" not "Great product"
- Include full name, title, company, and photo (note for HTML phase)
- Match testimonials to ICP demographics
- Position near pricing to ease decision anxiety
- Variety: different use cases, company sizes, outcomes

### Structure
- **3-5 testimonials** (odd numbers feel more authentic)
- Each testimonial:
  - **Quote**: 2-3 sentences max, specific result
  - **Attribution**: Name, Title, Company
  - **Photo**: Headshot (note for HTML phase)
  - **Metric** (optional): Highlighted stat from the quote

### Writing Testimonials (for user guidance)
If the user needs to create placeholder testimonials:
- Base on real customer outcomes if available
- Mark clearly as "[PLACEHOLDER - replace with real testimonial]"
- Structure: Situation → Solution → Result

### Ordering
- Lead with the strongest, most specific result
- Alternate between different ICPs
- End with a testimonial that addresses a common objection

---

## 9. FAQ Section

**Goal**: Handle final objections before they become reasons not to buy.

### Rules
- Lead with the most conversion-blocking questions first
- Keep answers scannable - long responses create new friction
- Use reassuring language, not defensive
- Include "safety" questions: cancellation, guarantees, trial terms
- Don't oversell in FAQ - stick to factual clarity

### Must-Include Questions
1. **Price objection**: "Is there a free trial?" / "What if it doesn't work for us?"
2. **Fit concern**: "Is this right for [ICP segment]?"
3. **Effort worry**: "How long does setup take?"
4. **Support question**: "What kind of support do you offer?"
5. **Trust question**: "Is my data secure?" / "Who else uses this?"

### Structure
- **6-8 questions** in expandable/accordion format
- Each Q&A:
  - **Question**: Written as the visitor would ask it (first person)
  - **Answer**: 2-4 sentences, factual, reassuring
  - **Link** (optional): To docs, pricing page, or case study

### Answer Tone
- Confident but not arrogant
- "Absolutely, and here's how..." not "Yes."
- Address the real concern behind the question

---

## 10. Final CTA Section

**Goal**: Close the loop - one last push for visitors who scrolled the entire page.

### Rules
- Repeat the core promise from the hero
- Same CTA label as hero for consistency bias
- Create urgency without pressure
- Add a secondary option for not-yet-ready visitors

### Structure
- **Headline**: Restate the core transformation (outcome, not product)
- **Subheadline**: Urgency or risk-reduction element
- **Primary CTA**: Same as hero CTA
- **Microcopy**: Risk reducer ("Cancel anytime", "No credit card required")
- **Secondary link** (optional): "Talk to sales" or "See a demo first"

### Urgency (only if authentic)
- Limited-time launch pricing
- Beta access ending
- Bonus expiring
- Seat limits

### When No Urgency Exists
- Focus on ease: "Get started in 2 minutes"
- Focus on risk: "Try free for 14 days - no commitment"
- Focus on social proof: "Join 5,000+ teams already using [product]"
