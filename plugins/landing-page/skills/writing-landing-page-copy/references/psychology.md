# Conversion Psychology Principles

Apply these principles when writing landing page copy. Each section should leverage at least one principle.

---

## 1. Loss Aversion

People fear losing more than they value gaining. The pain of losing $100 feels roughly twice as intense as the pleasure of gaining $100.

**Application**:
- Loss Aversion section: Amplify cost of inaction
- Pricing: "Save $200/year" (framed as avoiding a loss)
- CTA: "Don't miss out" or "Stop losing [thing]"
- FAQ: Address "what if I don't act" implicitly

**Caution**: Overuse creates anxiety and bounce. Use subtly.

---

## 2. Social Proof

People follow the actions of others, especially similar others, when uncertain.

**Application**:
- Trust bar: Logo count and "trusted by X companies"
- Testimonials: Specific results from relatable people
- Hero: User count or adoption metrics
- Pricing: "Most popular" badge on recommended tier
- FAQ: "Who else uses this?" answered with specifics

**Strength multipliers**:
- Specificity (numbers, names, companies)
- Similarity to visitor (same role, industry, company size)
- Recency (recent dates, current stats)
- Volume (high numbers signal safety)

---

## 3. Authority Bias

People defer to experts and established entities.

**Application**:
- Trust bar: Known brand logos, press mentions
- Features: Technical credibility, certifications
- Testimonials: Industry experts, known figures
- FAQ: Reference standards, compliance, expert endorsements

---

## 4. Cognitive Load Reduction

People avoid decisions that require too much mental effort. Simplicity converts.

**Application**:
- Process section: 3 steps max
- Pricing: 2-3 tiers with clear recommendation
- Benefits: Rule of 3
- CTA: One primary action per section
- Layout: White space, visual hierarchy, scannable formatting

**Rules**:
- Limit choices at every decision point
- Group related information
- Progressive disclosure (overview first, details on demand)
- Consistent patterns throughout the page

---

## 5. Reciprocity

People feel obligated to return favors. Giving value first increases willingness to engage.

**Application**:
- Free trial or freemium tier: Give before asking
- Hero: Lead with value, not an ask
- Content marketing reference: "Free guide", "Free audit"
- Process section: Show value at each step

---

## 6. Commitment & Consistency

Once people take a small step, they're more likely to take bigger ones to remain consistent.

**Application**:
- CTA progression: Low-commitment first ("See a demo" before "Buy now")
- Free trial → Paid conversion flow
- Email capture before purchase ask
- Process section: First step is trivially easy

---

## 7. Scarcity & Urgency

Limited availability increases perceived value and triggers faster decisions.

**Application**:
- Pricing: Limited-time offers, early-bird pricing
- CTA: "Limited beta access", "Only X spots left"
- Hero: Launch window, seasonal offer

**Rules**:
- Must be authentic - fake scarcity destroys trust permanently
- Time-based scarcity (deadline) is more ethical than quantity-based
- Urgency works best at the end of the page (after trust is built)

---

## 8. Anchoring

The first number people see influences all subsequent judgments.

**Application**:
- Pricing: Show enterprise tier first so Pro feels affordable
- Benefits: Lead with the biggest number ("Save 100+ hours/year")
- Testimonials: Lead with the most impressive result
- Hero: Big metric as the first thing visitors see

---

## 9. Framing Effect

How information is presented affects decisions more than the information itself.

**Application**:
- Pricing: "$9/day" vs "$270/month" (same cost, different perception)
- Benefits: "3x faster" vs "67% time reduction" (pick what sounds bigger)
- Loss aversion: "Stop losing $50K/year" vs "Save $50K/year"
- Process: "5-minute setup" vs "Quick setup" (specific beats vague)

---

## 10. Self-Interest Bias (WIIFM)

Every visitor subconsciously asks "What's In It For Me?" at every section.

**Application**:
- Every headline should answer WIIFM
- Features → Benefits translation: "AI-powered" → "Save 10 hours/week"
- Subheadlines amplify personal relevance
- Testimonials show relatable outcomes

**Test**: For every sentence, ask "So what?" If you can't answer with a direct benefit to the reader, rewrite it.
