## Example: Developer Tool (CI/CD Platform)

**Product**: ShipFast - CI/CD pipeline builder for small teams
**ICP**: Engineering leads at startups (10-50 devs)
**Core problem**: Slow, fragile CI pipelines that break on every merge

---

### Hero

> **Psychology**: Self-Interest (WIIFM) + Social Proof

**Headline**:
Ship 3x faster without breaking production

**Subheadline**:
The CI/CD platform built for teams that move fast. Set up in 5 minutes, not 5 sprints.

**CTA**:
Start building free | No credit card required

---

### Trust Bar

> **Psychology**: Authority Bias + Social Proof

Trusted by 2,000+ engineering teams

### Loss Aversion

> **Psychology**: Loss Aversion + Framing Effect

**Broken builds are costing you more than you think**

Every failed pipeline run costs your team 45 minutes of context-switching. That's 3 hours per developer per week spent waiting, debugging, and re-running instead of shipping.

**Your best engineers are fighting YAML, not building product**

Senior developers spend 20% of their time maintaining CI configurations. That's one day per week of your most expensive talent doing undifferentiated work.

**Every slow merge is a feature your competitor ships first**

While your team waits for 30-minute builds, the market moves on. The cost of slow delivery compounds every quarter.

---

### Benefits

> **Psychology**: Self-Interest + Anchoring

**Deploy in minutes, not hours**
Parallel builds and smart caching cut your pipeline from 30 minutes to under 3. Your team ships while the coffee is still hot.

**Zero-config for 90% of projects**
Auto-detects your stack, sets up testing, builds, and deploys. No YAML engineering degree required.

**Catch failures before they merge**
Preview environments and automated checks on every PR mean broken code never reaches main. Sleep better on deploy days.

---

### Process

> **Psychology**: Cognitive Load Reduction + Commitment

**1. Connect your repo** (30 seconds)
One-click GitHub/GitLab integration. ShipFast reads your project and configures itself.

**2. Push your code** (business as usual)
Every commit triggers parallel builds, tests, and preview deploys automatically.

**3. Ship with confidence** (the good part)
Automated rollbacks, deploy previews, and real-time logs. You push, we handle the rest.

---

### Features

> **Psychology**: Authority Bias + Self-Interest

**Parallel test execution** - Run your test suite across 32 workers. What took 20 minutes now takes 40 seconds.

**Smart dependency caching** - Automatic layer caching for Docker, npm, pip, and cargo. 80% faster cold starts.

**Preview environments** - Every PR gets a live URL. QA, product, and design review real changes, not screenshots.

**Instant rollbacks** - One-click rollback to any previous deploy. Recovery in seconds, not hours.

**Build insights** - See exactly what's slow and why. Flame graphs for your pipeline.

**SOC2 compliant** - Enterprise-grade security. Audit logs, SSO, and role-based access built in.

### Testimonials

> **Psychology**: Social Proof + Authority

**"We cut deploy time from 45 minutes to 3. Our team ships 4x more PRs per week now."**
— Sarah Chen, VP Engineering, Acme (Series B, 35 engineers)

**"I set up our entire CI/CD pipeline during a lunch break. No joke. Previously it took us two sprints with Jenkins."**
— Marcus Rivera, Staff Engineer, TechCorp

**"The preview environments alone justified the switch. Product and design can review every PR without asking engineering for a staging deploy."**
— Priya Sharma, Engineering Lead, Designhub (15-person startup)

### FAQ

> **Psychology**: Cognitive Load Reduction + Reciprocity

**Is there a free tier?**
Yes. The Starter plan is free forever with 1,000 build minutes per month. No credit card required to start.

**How long does migration take?**
Most teams are fully migrated in under an hour. We auto-import your existing CI config and suggest optimizations.

**Will this work with our monorepo?**
Absolutely. We have first-class monorepo support with smart change detection - only rebuild what changed.

**Is our source code secure?**
We never store your source code. Builds run in ephemeral containers that are destroyed after each run. We're SOC2 Type II certified.

**Can we self-host?**
Enterprise plans include a self-hosted option. Talk to sales for details.

**What happens if a deploy goes wrong?**
One-click rollback to any previous version. Average recovery time is under 30 seconds.
